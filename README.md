# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This repository contains the implementation of a linear regression model to predict house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The dataset used is from the [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition on Kaggle.

## Overview

In this project, we implement a linear regression model to predict house prices. The key features used for prediction are:
- Square footage of the living area (`GrLivArea`)
- Number of bedrooms (`BedroomAbvGr`)
- Number of full bathrooms (`FullBath`)

The goal is to understand the relationship between these features and the house price (`SalePrice`), and to build a simple predictive model using **Linear Regression**.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is from the Kaggle competition: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

The dataset consists of 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

### Download Dataset

To use the dataset, either download it directly from the competition page or use the **Kaggle API**:

1. Install Kaggle CLI:
    ```bash
    pip install kaggle
    ```
2. Authenticate the API by placing your `kaggle.json` file (from your Kaggle account) into the `.kaggle` directory.
3. Download the dataset:
    ```bash
    kaggle competitions download -c house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques
    ```
4. Unzip the dataset into the working directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or above
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running notebooks)

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd house-price-prediction
    ```

3. Install the necessary Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download the dataset and place it in the directory as described above.

## Usage

To run the project:

1. Ensure that you have downloaded the dataset and placed it in the correct directory.
2. Run the script that implements the linear regression model:

    ```bash
    python linear_regression_house_prices.py
    ```

Alternatively, you can open the Jupyter notebook (`house_price_prediction.ipynb`) to run the project interactively.

### Features

The script processes the following features:
- **GrLivArea** (square footage of the living area)
- **BedroomAbvGr** (number of bedrooms above ground)
- **FullBath** (number of full bathrooms)

The model will output predicted house prices based on these features.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values.
- **R-squared (R²)**: Indicates how well the regression model fits the data (values closer to 1 indicate better performance).

## Results

The results of the model will be printed to the console, including:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (R²) value

You can also visualize the relationship between actual and predicted prices using a scatter plot generated by the script.
